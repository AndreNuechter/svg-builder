# svg-builder

An app to help with the creation of complex svg markup that can be used directly in HTML. 

## Getting started

To try it out clone this repo and initialize it via NPM. Then execute eg `node app` and navigate to localhost:3000, preferably using Firefox (it works in at least Chrome too, but looks worse, since the CSS is differently interpreted and I haven't quite figured out in what way).

As this is work in progress, there're a couple of rough edges and missing features. Here I want to list a few things that might get added in the future...
